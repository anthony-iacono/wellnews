/*

The article container is set to flex-row to keep the feed centered on the page.
This means that flex-column can be applied to the articles display while
keeping the row-centered orientation.

React natively has some center orientation applied, but it can cause issues when
orienting individual elements. Applying flex-center to a container overrides the
native centering in the cascade and makes it easier to troubleshoot styling
issues.
